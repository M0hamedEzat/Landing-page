## Instructions

* Hello ! </br>
I have done the requirements of this project and its the following:
    1- build nav bar
    2- scroll on click of the specific section
    3- style the active element
    4- Usability for all  modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

I have used "forEach loop" to add to each section:-
    1-<li> and inside it <a>
    2-data-nav and the id of each section
    3-adds style to each <a> that is inside the <li> in nav bar
    4-"scroll into event" to scroll for the choosen section
    5-dynamically to add new section "make a new section in html code and it will be automatically added on the nav bar"


and also I have created a function and inside a "for Each loop"
to show when a section is active.
